## About the Implementation
* The commits in the repo are not squashed as they would be in a PR. This is to allow reviewers to see an unfiltered view of the development process. Although those early commits may look silly in hind-sight, it's honest, and we all have start somewhere!
* No linting was added because these are generally team-based decisions that don't make sense to add for an exercise in isolation.
* While looking for a dependency to provide data for a list of countries and US states, I discovered an issue with one repo and [reported it](https://github.com/marchah/node-countries/issues/1).
